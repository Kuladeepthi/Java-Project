PROJECT_TITLE : Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algo.
GROUP_MEMBERS : B. DEEPTHI and S.SUDHARSHANA.
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION : In this project we are using a dataset that contains distances of different stations from the origin point(TOKYO).
                      Taking the dataset as input our goal is to find the shortest path and optimized path using dijkstra's and kruskal's algorithms respectively.
